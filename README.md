"Tsundoku" (n.) is the condition of acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them.

### Idea

If you are like me, you like the idea of reading... but you never read... You buy books that seem interesting and 
they just end up being a decoration
This program lets you search through the google books api and displays information on the books.
If you have an account, you will have access to a 'My Account' page where you can see your books you've favorited
